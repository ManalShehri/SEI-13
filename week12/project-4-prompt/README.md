# Your Final Project

## Overview


**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most
advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully
be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

You get to call the shots and invent your own idea, choosing a framework and
tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything
you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little
outside of your comfort zone.**

***Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor*** so you can make
sure it's something you can accomplish in the limited time we have, and make
sure it's something that'll be impressive visually. Sometimes people do
judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

## Groups or Solo?

You **may** work in a group. If you choose to do so, you will be responsible for forming your own groups. Max group size is **three devs**!

## Technical Requirements

Your app must \(unless otherwise approved\):

- **Use the technologies we have covered in the course to build a FullStack Web Application** 
  #### Backend
  - **Django + PostgreSQL** 
  - **Express + MongoDB**
  #### Frontend
  - **EJS tempaltes** 
  - **React** 
- **Create the application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
- Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of your models
  - At least one PUT
  - At least one DELETE
  - At least one POST
  - At least 2 GETs

- Add authentication **AND authorization** \(page protection\) to restrict access to appropriate users 
    - User must be able to sign up or login
    - Signed in user must be able to change password and logout
    - change password and logout must only be avialable to loggedin users
- Give feedback to the user after each action, and after form submissions with success/failure. 
- Clear forms after submission failure.
- Make application responsive
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
**Put effort into your design!**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

### Stretch Goals
- Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Allow user to change website theme, Dark mode etc. 
- Include Pagination.
- Utilize 3rd party API's.
- Use other React hooks like useContext() or user defined etc.
- Sent verification email upon registeration. 
- Allow users to reset password if the users can't login. 
- Allow users to upload image files.
- Add the ability to chat between users. 
- Utilize a text API like [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A `readme.md` file** with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Documentation of your **application architecture**
      - Entity Relationship Diagram **(ERD)** or **Data Model.**
      - Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
      - Your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
- **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
