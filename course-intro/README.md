# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Welcome to SEI!!! 🎉

## Introductions
Welcome to your first day of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive! Let's all introduce ourselves! 
Everyone should introduce him/herself by sharing:
- Name
- Why you chose SEI at MISK-GA

## Course Content Overview 
GA's global team has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover and a suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this curriculum based on our own experiences as instructors and the unique features of the job market. We also iterate on this curriculum constantly so technologies and concepts change with each cohort.

A non-exhaustive list of technologies we cover...

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* NodeJS/Express
* MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
* PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
* Ruby/Rails

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you to learn and work in any web development technologies.

> What are some technologies and languages you know of that are involved in web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, Python, Databases).

* There will be no scheduled lessons
* You will present your project at the end of the week 🎉

### Communicating with Your Instructors

The instructors are here for you and to help you succeed, but we can't be available to you 24/7. There will be dedicated time for instructors to provide students with support outside of lessons. These are:
- **Office Hours**
- **Lab Support**
- **Project Support**

These are times when instructors are available to help you with bugs, answer questions or provide advice. The goal of this program is to turn you in to a self-sufficient software engineer, so our expectation is that you try to resolve issues on your own as much as possible. We use the remaining time to prepare lessons, grade projects, etc.


### How to Ask for Help?

Asking for help is what students find hardest in SEIR. It is also what ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.

* Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
* **Knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers** are two of the biggest skills you can gain from this class and will be incredibly valuable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

How can we ask for help efficiently?

* Ask a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
* Your instructors and peers won't be able to help you if...
  * The question you're asking isn't constructive
  * It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer. This means taking the following steps...
    1. First, try it yourself
    2. Then, Google it
    3. Then, ask your neighbor
    4. Finally, ask an instructor

> Check out
> [this document](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/effective_questions)
> if you'd like to learn more about how to ask effective questions.

**Plese note**: If you run into a technical issue that is specific to your code during the lecture, please direct message the IA that's on-camera that day for help, instead of interrupting the lecture.

## Course Policies
### Plagiarism
MiSk-GA is not a traditional educational institution, but we share some things in common with more traditional programs. We have a plagiarism policy in place to create a healthy classroom culture where students prioritize their learning above all other goals for the duration of the cohort. We create a space where it is 'safe to fail' since 'failure' is such an integral part of the learning process.

* You can't ask external people to do your work
* You must understand your submissions -- if you can't explain them then the assumption is that it is not your direct work
* If you collaborate, you have to indicate that you did in a comment on the submission
* You have to comment where you have used an external resource such as a tutorial or a forum - make sure even still you aren't overly reliant on anything. Use a few lines of code at most.
* Make sure you're googling parts of problems rather than the whole problem. The problem solving part of code is the hardest part - make sure you're doing that part too! These aren't research assignments!
* We will idscuss inside the teachin team and if a submissions is deemed not up to the plagiarism standard, it will not be graded and it will be flagged to Studnet Success Office.

### Homework
* Each day you will be given a homework assignment that is due the next morning at 9:00 AM. 
* You must complete 80% of these homeworks to graduate the class.
* They are graded on a 👍 or 👎 basis -- either they are complete or not. Whether they are complete or not depends on the effort you put in. They don't have to be 100% perfect or absolutely correct, but you do need to show that you put time into getting the correct answer.
> Please refer to
> [this documen](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-alahsa/course-intro/blob/master/homework.md)
> for more details on our approach to homework submission and grading

### Attendance
* You must be on the Zoom call with your camera turned on to be counted present. IAs will be taking presence.
* 3 late joininigs add up to 1 absence. Only 3 absences total are permitted. If you are absent, please notify the instructors and watch the class recording.
* If you know you will be late or absent ahead of time, please reach out to the IA on duty and let them know. 

### There's no winning or losing

* This is a non-competitive environment.
* You get out what you put in.
* Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you only.
* Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

### Cooperation & Teamwork

* You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding **together** for the next 12 weeks.
* Teamwork will be paramount to your success as an SEIR student and beyond. Programming is a teamwork-driven profession. You will learn more from each other than from the instructors!

## Classroom Etiquette

* Let's all collaborate, what are the behaviors we *do* want in our class? What are the ones we *don't* want?
* [Class Etiquette](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-alahsa/course-intro/blob/master/class_etiquette.md)

## Administrative Checks / Student Agreements
- Update Slack
  - Username should be your full name (first and last name)
  - Profile image should be an image of you where we can clearly see your face
- Update GitHub Enterprise
  - Name should be your full name (first and last name)
  - Profile image should be an image of you where we can clearly see your face
- Review [Plagiarism rules](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-alahsa/course-intro/blob/master/plagiarism.md)

## Additional considerations

### Re-learning how to learn

* The **MOST** significant skill you will gain from this course is not proficiency in a particular web framework or programming language, but rather learning how to teach yourself
* You will learn this in an environment that is specifically tailored to this goal, where there is heavy support, instruction designed to structure your self-learning process, and safety to 'fail'.
* We will progressively "back off" over the course of the cohort, encouraging the development of your autonomy as a developer, allowing you to stand strong on your own.

* Don't be too hard on yourself.
* You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.
* The first couple days would mostly be review, but we're going to ramp up the rigor and difficulty of the course slowly but surely! 

### Productive Struggle

* The pace of this course is designed to push you past your limits.
* The brain is like a muscle; sometimes it gets sore.
* Struggling with the material doesn't mean you aren't learning; on the contrary, it reflects sustained and meaningful engagement with the material.

### Balance

* This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
* Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

> Consider making a daily schedule for yourself to prioritize what's important to you - time spent with loved ones, working out, preparing healthy meals, etc. Find a balance between the hard work needed for this course and taking care of yourself.

### The Emotional Cycle of Change

![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)

Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

The growth mindset here is understanding that even when something doesn't work, it will still make you a better coder! We want this to be challenging for you because...

* Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
* You can't BS your way through code.
* The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
* Google is your best friend

Throughout the course of SEI many students say something along the lines of "I don't know how to do that." Many of you certainly will. If you do, however, just add "...yet" to the end of that sentence.
