# Git Basics

## Lab: Crafting A Commit

Read over the following blog posts and carefully think about what a good commit
message would be. Take some time to come up with your own. Be ready to share
your commit with the rest of the class.

- [What's in a Good Commit?](http://dev.solita.fi/2013/07/04/whats-in-a-good-commit.html)
- [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

Now that we've made our first commit, let's see what happens when we type `git log`... We see our previous commit! This typically shows all of our previous
commits, but since we just have one, that's all we see. Feel free to play around
with options for `git log`, like `--oneline`, `--name-status`, and `--relative-date`
for example. For all options [click here.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

## Lab: Branching Your Dreams

   you would have wanted to happen to Ned.

1. Switch back to your `master` branch. (Notice anything?) Add what really
   happened to Ned.

1. Stage and commit your changes.

you may have noticed).
