# Flexbox and CSS

## Introduction

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the mockup images, and build your own version of what you see.

>Don't worry if you can't get it to look exactly as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it. If you feel lost consider going through this [short tutorial](http://learnlayout.com/)
