## 99 bottles of coke

"99 Bottles of coke" is a traditional reverse counting song. 


It is popular to sing on long trips, as it is repetitive and easy to memorize but -- it can take a long time to sing.


Lets try and make it run a little quicker using code:

Write a function that takes the number of bottles as an argument and sings the song starting from the number you've passed all the way to the end _(ie, 0)_.

The song's lyrics are as follows:
```
99 bottles of coke on the wall, 99 bottles of coke.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of coke on the wall...
```
The same verse is repeated, each time with one bottle fewer, until there are none left.


Bear in mind, not all verses are the same. The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:

```
1 bottle of coke on the wall, 1 bottle of coke.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of coke on the wall.
```

The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:
```
No more bottles of coke on the wall, no more bottles of coke.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of coke on the wall.
```

#### Bonus:
- Be able to count between a range of numbers (ie, 20 to 10).
- Make the song verses' text color alternate between blue and red.
- Make the last line of the song green.
